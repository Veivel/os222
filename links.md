1. [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)<br>

  UTM is an alternative to VirtualBox that runs on the Apple Silicon Chip (M1). Our fantastic lecturer Pak RMS
  has kindly prepared [an in-depth tutorial](https://doit.vlsm.org/009.html) on how to setup a Debian VM with UTM.

2. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)<br>

  FileZilla is an FTP client like WinSCP, except of course WinSCP is not available on MacOS. FileZilla functions 
  almost identically to WinSCP, though you may first need to run the Configuration Wizard under `Settings > FTP > Overview`. Make sure passive mode is
  prioritized and enable your external IP address if given the option.
