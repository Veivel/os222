## Setting Up with M1 (Week 00 - 01)

1. [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)<br>

  UTM is an alternative to VirtualBox that runs on the Apple Silicon Chip (M1). Our fantastic lecturer Pak RMS
  has kindly prepared [an in-depth tutorial](https://doit.vlsm.org/009.html) on how to setup a Debian VM with UTM.

2. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)<br>

  FileZilla is an FTP client like WinSCP, except of course WinSCP is not available on MacOS. FileZilla functions 
  almost identically to WinSCP, though you may first need to run the Configuration Wizard under `Settings > FTP > Overview`. Make sure passive mode is
  prioritized and enable your external IP address if given the option.

3. [Bash in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g)<br>

  Being a Mac M1 user has exactly one benefit in the Operating Systems course: familiarity with Bash (or Bash-based, like Zsh) scripting languages. The       video linked is not exactly a tutorial but it gives a pretty neat big-picture view of it. Bash is ESSENTIAL to making the most use of Linux (and Mac, to   an extent) so don't hesitate to search for more in-depth Bash guides.
