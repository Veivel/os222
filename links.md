1. [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)<br>

UTM is an alternative to VirtualBox that runs on the Apple Silicon Chip (M1). Our fantastic lecturer Pak RMS <br>
has kindly prepared [an in-depth tutorial](https://doit.vlsm.org/009.html) on how to setup a Debian VM with UTM.

2. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)<br>

FileZilla is an FTP client like WinSCP, except of course WinSCP is not available on MacOS. <br> FileZilla functions 
almost identically to WinSCP, though you may first need to run the Configuration Wizard under `Settings > FTP > Overview`.
