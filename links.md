## Setting Up with M1 (Week 00 - 01)

1. [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)<br>

  UTM is an alternative to VirtualBox that runs on the Apple Silicon Chip (M1). Our fantastic lecturer Pak RMS
  has kindly prepared [an in-depth tutorial](https://doit.vlsm.org/009.html) on how to setup a Debian VM with UTM.

2. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)<br>

  FileZilla is an FTP client like WinSCP, except of course WinSCP is not available on MacOS. FileZilla functions 
  almost identically to WinSCP, though you may first need to run the Configuration Wizard under `Settings > FTP > Overview`. Make sure passive mode is
  prioritized and enable your external IP address if given the option.

3. [Bash in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g)<br>

  Being a Mac M1 user has exactly one benefit in the Operating Systems course: familiarity with Bash (or Bash-based, like Zsh) scripting languages. The       video linked is not exactly a tutorial but it gives a pretty neat big-picture view of it. Bash is ESSENTIAL to making the most use of Linux (and Mac, to   an extent) so don't hesitate to search for more in-depth Bash guides.
  
## Week 02

1. [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/)<br>

  Where to start with Regex? This website provides step-by-step lessons for understanding Regex while still giving you freedom to experiment with it along the way.

2. [What is a Checksum?](https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/)<br> 
  
  After doing the Week 02 assignments, you may have questions about the SHA checksum and myscript.sh. I know I did, but fortunately this page along with Pak RMS' thorough explanation had made clear what exactly  myscript.sh does.

3. Intro to C:  [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm) and [JavaTPoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-programming-language-tutorial)

  The two links above are excellent complements to Week 02's C Programming Demos.

## Week 03

1. [UIC OS Course Notes](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/)

  I found this while trying to learn about File Systems. This page contains a concise summary of each chapter from Silberschatz's OSC textbook, eighth edition. Do note that the edition difference means not everything is up-to-date.

2. [tldr.sh](https://tldr.sh/)

  TLDR is a man-like package that serves as a tldr page for various commands and packages, instead of an in-depth manual (like man). A friend told me about this and I found this handy while trying to understand new linux commands. 

3. [Intro to Linux filesystems](https://opensource.com/life/16/10/introduction-linux-filesystems)

  The page above is a good read to prepare for Week 03 assignments. It helps to really understand what you're doing instead of copy-pasting commands.

# Week 04

1. [Virtual Memory: A Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiwt1iVUib9s2Uo5BeYmwkDFUh70fJPxX)

  The playlist above provides excellent explanations into certain areas about Virtual Memory. I specifically found the video on Page Tables helpful.

2. [Pointers in C](https://youtu.be/mw1qsMieK5c)

  This week we delve deeper into C, with a highlight on pointers. My Week 02 links have been a good place to start, but the video above explains it in more detail.
